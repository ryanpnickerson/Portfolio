## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/ryanpnickerson/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Homeowners-Insurance.png"> **[Homeowner's Insurance Quote Conversion](https://github.com/ryanpnickerson/Portfolio/blob/main/Project%20Analysis/Homeowner%20Quotes/488a590ba83845e1af5a11495ec7b538.ipynb)**

In this project I used logistic regression, random forest, and deep learning to determine the strongest parameters for sucessfully converting a homeowner's insurance quote. The data set history was short and the number of parameters provided were limited. Although a high level of model accuracy was not obtained, 
valuable insight was gained into what makes for a succesful quote conversion.

In this project I looked at a dataset that was geospatially tied to a location. I first plot the data using standard means (line graphs, bar charts, histograms, etc.) and later show how using a map can drastically increase the readability of the dataset.

In this project I wanted to attempt to predict the outcome of the final 5 match weeks of the Premier League. I compiled my own dataset of matchweek statistics over the last few seasons, split my dataset 80/20 for training and testing, then showed how my models' predictions differed from the actual results. I will be using multivariate regressions and time series analysis to train my models.

In this project I wanted to come up with a loose roadmap of how LinkedIn could better incorporate students actively searching for a job in their platform. Are there better search criteria for students? Can the social network be introduced to students differently? How do you get colleges and universities involved?
