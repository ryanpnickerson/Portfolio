## Projects

In this project I used logistic regression, random forest, and deep learning to determine the strongest parameters for sucessfully converting a homeowner's insurance quote. The data set history was short and the number of parameters provided were limited. Although a high level of model accuracy was not obtained, 
valuable insight was gained into what makes for a succesful quote conversion.

In this project I used data from the last 100 Kentucky Derbies to create the ideal horse and jockey pairing. At the end I played around with logistic regression to predict how likely a horse and jockey were to win, place, and/or show.

In this project I looked at a dataset that was geospatially tied to a location. I first plot the data using standard means (line graphs, bar charts, histograms, etc.) and later show how using a map can drastically increase the readability of the dataset.

In this project I wanted to come up with a loose roadmap of how LinkedIn could better incorporate students actively searching for a job in their platform. Are there better search criteria for students? Can the social network be introduced to students differently? How do you get colleges and universities involved?
