folder for all the data and code for the map visualization project

PLEASE NOTE: I am unable to upload the shapefile used in this data due it its size. If you want to run this code for yourself please download them here: https://github.com/carnot-technologies/MapVisualizations/tree/master/shape_files/India_Districts_2020
PLEASE NOTE: I did not add the individual frames to save storage, if you wish to see the individual frames please run the code and save them locally
PLEASE NOTE: In order to see the maps you have to download the notebook and mark it as trusted
PLEASE NOTE: You can download the final mp4 video from this repo (test.mp4) or you can run the notebook all the way through and it will display in-line
